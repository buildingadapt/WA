# Technical Guideline 050 

Technical Guideline 50 (TG050) represents a pioneering initiative to establish a dedicated set of technical guidelines and tools that support climate resilience and adaptation in government buildings across Western Australia. Grounded in extensive research into international best practices and informed by local case studies, TG050 provides actionable guidance and practical tools for project teams. Its purpose is to enable the design, delivery, and long-term operation of buildings that are capable of withstanding extreme climate hazards and maintaining resilience throughout their lifecycle.
